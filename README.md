# Hangman Game: Countries Around the World
Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a fun and educational game that tests your knowledge of countries around the world. This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be played on any web browser.

## How to Play
The rules of the game are simple. The computer will randomly select a country, and you have to guess the name of the country letter by letter. For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman will be drawn. You have 6 incorrect guesses before the game is over.


## Installation

## Usage
Once you open the game, you will be presented with a blank space for the country name, and a keyboard to make your guesses. Click on a letter to make a guess. If the letter is in the country name, it will be revealed. If not, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
The game ends either when you successfully guess the country name, or when the hangman is fully drawn.
